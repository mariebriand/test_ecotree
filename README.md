This is a technical test I had when looking for a junior fullstack role back in 2022.

I did not know Symfony back then, so I could not spot the mistakes related to the framework.
However, the company did offer me a job as they knew I had no previous knowledge. (I declined because I had already accepted my current company's offer)

So, this could be a good example to follow if you encounter similar exercice!
The assignement was: "Review this as if you were a Senior developer reviewing a junior's pull request".
